Initially setting up the scope and the depth of the project was handled by the team as a whole. We spent a few class days discussing the purpose and more importantly our reason for doing our project and finding data. We to extended our the Portfolio Analysis homework assignment with complexity by having two completly different industries as we felt it was vital for this project. We decided to conduct a financial analysis on 5 to industry-focused portfolios of airlines and top 5 tech companies to properly provide "Harold" with an accurate analysis of how Covid-19 affected it's future including the stock market data.

## Loading Data
With the use of www.alphavantage.co we were able to load json and corresponding close prices for 3 portfolios (Airline, Technology and stock market) and two distinctive  time periods (Pre-Covid & Post-Covid). We normalized all tables/data within our jupyter notebook to ensure optimal flexibility and workability.

We imported quarterly data of 2019-2020 top 5 airline companies such as American Airline "AAL", United Airlines "UAL",Southwest Airline "LUV", Delta Airline "DAL", Alaska Airline "AL" 

Likewise for Tech companies we are gathering quterly data of Apple "AAPL",Alphabet "GOOGL", Amazon "AMZN", Microsoft "MSFT", and Facebook "FB" from www.alphavantage.co. 
Gerated key from Alphadvantage which we incorporated it into jupyter notebook using python libraries "from dotenv import load_dotenv and key = os.getenv("alphavantage_api_key") which furnished us with JSON dataset.

We used For loop and GetResqset to convert that data to CSV files. 
We also needed to import stock price of each industires and S&P 500 dataset.

## Data Cleaning 
Once we had our data csv files together, Data needed to clean and sort data. There was a lot of effort and iteration that went into our final analysis and presentation. Will, Shrey,Brandon and I spent countless hours perfecting the code to make it standardized allowing plug and play functionality. Below you will find several parts of the iteration process.
We used for loop to request data for each company and converted into csv files using to_csv. 
With little help from array we cleaned our data and used hvplot for visual so it can be pleaseing to Harold's eyes.

We also used new library called "Time"

## End Notes
To complete this project we used the concepts discussed in class; Python, Pandas, various libraries, and Simulation Visuals.

## Analysis given to Harold:
